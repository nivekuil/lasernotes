One-day project done in pure HTML5/JS that creates a virtual "keyboard" created by a camera (webcam, smartphone), and played by a color (laser pointer). One file, no dependencies.

Move camera so that it's pointing at an unbroken, dimly lit wall. Use a laser pointer within the camera's vision to play notes based on its horizontal position.
